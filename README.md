# Outpost Engine

Newly in-progress game set in the near future in a non-specific post apocalyptic wasteland where a group of survivors repair a train and use it to venture further and further into increasingly dangerous territory searching for an alleged promise land that lies beyond. The core gameplay loop aims to contain the following mechanics:
- Base building
- Tower defense
- Customizable mobile base (the train!)
- RTS combat
- Unit recruitment & management
- Resource management
- Supply routes
